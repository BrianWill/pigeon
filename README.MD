# Pigeon, an educational programming language

More accurately, *two* educational programming languages:

- DynamicPigeon
- StaticPigeon

DynamicPigeon ([docs](dynamic-pigeon.md))teaches basic programming concepts common to all mainstream languages:

- variables
- operations
- control flow (if, while)
- local and global variables
- functions
- lists and hashmaps

StaticPigeon builds upon DynamicPigeon to teach most of the core concepts of the Go language. Once a student is comfortable with StaticPigeon, learning Go should then mostly be a matter of adjusting to different syntax.

StaticPigeon is logically split into two tiers for easier learning.

The first tier ([docs](static-pigeon-tier-2.md)) includes:

- static typing
- multi-return functions
- structs
- methods
- interfaces
- pointers
- typeswitchs
- foreach loops
- break and continue statements
- imports
- standard library file and util packages

The second tier ([docs](static-pigeon-tier-2.md)) includes:

- arrays and slices
- function variables, nested functions, closures
- goroutines
- channels, `select` statements
- bitwise operations
- standard library networking packages

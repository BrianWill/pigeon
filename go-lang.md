## Learning Go after StaticPigeon

Once you've learned StaticPigeon, learning Go is primarily a matter of learning the different syntax and the essential parts of the Go standard library (which is much, much larger than what StaticPigeon offers). Additionally, there are some small semantic changes and additions.

## infix operator syntax

Most operators in Go are denoted by symbols:

```
+       addition
-       subtraction, negation
*       multiplication
/       division
==      equality
!=      not equality
!       not
<       less than
>       greater than
<=      less than or equal
>=      greater than or equal
&&      logical and
||      logical or
&       bitwise and
|       bitwise or
^       bitwise not

```
